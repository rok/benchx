# End-to-end demonstration of prototype-design.md §6: both profiles, both shapes.
#
# The script plays two roles. First the user, who prepares the environment
# with their own tools: a git repository with two commits, and three CMake
# build directories (benchx builds nothing). Then the calling script, which
# alternates the sides and assigns round and slot, since that loop belongs to
# the caller (benchmark-environments.md §5.7).
#
# Every command is printed before it runs, as you would type it: `bx` stands
# for `$PYTHON -m benchx.cli`, and $WORK for the scratch directory.
#
# Needs cmake, a C++ compiler, and network access the first time, to fetch
# Google Benchmark unless it is installed. ROUNDS=5 by default.
#
# `bx run` delivers every result to the one local store,
# ~/.benchx/store.parquet (BENCHX_HOME=... relocates it), so the store and
# each series' history grow from run to run. `bx head` shows the latest rows
# at any time.
