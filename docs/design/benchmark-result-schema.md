# Benchmark Measurement Result Schema and Migration Contract

**Status:** Minimal draft incorporating source, metrology, and design-partner review

**Author:** Rok Mihevc

**Review date:** 2026-09-11

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the minimum model needed to ingest, compare, and migrate computing benchmark results without inventing statistical meaning. Detection, alerts, thresholds, scheduling, run lifecycle, and environment setup are out of scope.

> A **measurement result** records the evidence from one measurement attempt for one quantity and one workload variant, together with its conditions and provenance. It holds individual repeated measurements as observations when the producer provides them; an aggregate-only result is valid.

One attempt may report several quantities. CPU time, GPU time, peak memory, and a correctness metric are separate scalar results with separate units, joined by a shared `attempt_key`. A retry is a new attempt with a new key.

> **Reported coordinates** are the facts a producer reports about what was measured and under which conditions: project, designated source, benchmark identity, workload variant, subject, quantity, comparison context, environment, and optional resource selection. They exclude the designated source revision, which is the history axis, and all provenance such as attempt/run keys and timestamps.

> **Comparison identity** is the projection of reported coordinates that project policy requires to match before two estimates are points in the same history. Producers report coordinates; they never declare identity or series membership.

> A **series** is one comparison identity projected through one estimator and followed across revisions of the designated subject source:
>
> **policy(reported coordinates) × estimator**

The estimator is a projection as well: one observation batch feeds a mean series and a median series without being stored twice (§4.5). The server fingerprints reported coordinates for audit, applies a versioned identity policy, and materializes series as rebuildable indexes (§4.3).

Two sources appear on every result. The top-level `source`/`revision` identify the subject component whose revisions form the history axis. `benchmark` identifies the code that defined and executed the workload; its exact revision is a reported coordinate that policy normally maps to a declared benchmark version or an audited continuity mapping rather than splitting history on every benchmark commit. A composite subject such as Arrow–NumPy interoperability names every component, designates one as the axis, and pins the others (§4.2).

Conditions intentionally allowed to vary, such as kernel or glibc version, are recorded per result as **observed context**. They annotate history without splitting it (§4.2).

For example, one series could track:

- project: Apache Arrow benchmarks; subject/source: Apache Arrow from `https://github.com/apache/arrow`;
- workload variant: Parquet read with Snappy compression;
- quantity: wall time in seconds;
- estimator: mean;
- subject configuration: release build with Clang 18;
- benchmark identity: the suite source/revision;
- comparison context: protocol version, Python 3.12, and the warmup/calibration strategy;
- environment: runner `bench-01` with a specified CPU and core policy; resource selection: absent, or a GPU UUID/device index for a per-device result.

Each subject revision contributes zero or more results, producing the history shown in a benchmark chart. Under this policy, changing a workload parameter, quantity, comparison-context value, or environment yields a different series; a different estimator yields a different series over the same coordinates; changing only the attempt/run key or timestamp never does, and changing the kernel or glibc version does not under this example's policy, which treats them as observed context rather than as a property of those components.

The common operations are to find a series, order its results by revision, plot estimates, inspect observation batches, group an attempt's quantities, and trace a result to its producer. The indexed core is therefore scalar; richer data remains representable without first-class tables.

## 2. Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning here |
|---|---|
| **Run** | Orchestration-level grouping created by a scheduler, CLI, CI job, or similar work-order author. |
| **Attempt** | One execution request and outcome for one workload variant; it may complete, fail, or be skipped. A retry is a new attempt. |
| **Workload** | Named benchmark operation before its parameter domain is expanded. |
| **Parameter assignment** | One concrete value for each parameter of a workload, such as `{"size": 100}` from a domain of `size = [10, 100, 1000]`. |
| **Workload variant** | A workload plus one parameter assignment. |
| **Subject** | Implementation or system under test. It may contain several named components; one source is the revision axis. |
| **Quantity** | Named scalar output with a canonical unit, such as `wall-time` in `s` or `peak-rss` in `By`. An open, project-extensible vocabulary (§4.4). Canonical units use UCUM when representable. |
| **Estimator** | Rule producing a scalar estimate, such as mean, median, minimum, slope, a percentile, a function of several input quantities, or a source-defined value. Selected by policy as a series projection; reported only inside estimate summaries, never as a coordinate. |
| **Reported coordinates** | Producer-reported facts describing what was measured and under which conditions, fingerprinted before any policy is applied. |
| **Projection** | A function the identity policy applies to reported coordinates: it selects the subset that must match and normalizes their values, for example canonical source URIs or a version mapped to a declared line (§4.3). |
| **Comparison identity** | The projection of reported coordinates that must match for comparison. |
| **Series** | Derived comparison-time construct: one comparison identity × one estimator under one identity-policy schema. It exists from its first point; a comparison between points is a separate document (§5.5). Materialized as an index; never declared by producers. |
| **Observation** | One measured value produced by a repetition after declared normalization. |
| **Observation batch** | Observations of one quantity from one attempt. Three repetitions producing 1.0 ms, 1.1 ms, and 1.0 ms are three observations in one batch. |
| **Estimate** | Scalar produced by applying an estimator to an observation batch, used for plots and analysis; not a known “true value.” Producer estimates are typed summaries on the immutable result; derived estimates are series points. |
| **Statistic** | Numeric summary computed from observations, such as a mean, median, percentile, or standard deviation. |
| **Precision statistic** | Statistic describing observation dispersion, such as standard deviation, MAD, or IQR. |
| **Measurement uncertainty** | Uncertainty associated with an estimate. It is not synonymous with error or observation spread. |
| **Environment** | Host or allocation shared by an attempt's results, especially runner and hardware identity. |

In metrology, the quantity intended for a workload variant at a revision is the **measurand**; it needs no database entity here. Use `accuracy`, `precision`, `error`, `bias`, `confidence interval`, and `coverage interval` only with their defined meanings, and preserve source terminology when its exact meaning is unknown.

## 3. Design rules

1. **Producers report facts; policy derives identity.** A result carries reported coordinates, never a comparison identity or series identifier (§4.3).
2. **The designated subject revision is the series axis.** Ingest time is not historical order; dirty working-tree state is a per-result flag, never a revision property (§4.1).
3. **One result contains one quantity and unit.** A multi-output attempt emits several results joined by `attempt_key`; tuple outputs are split into named scalar quantities.
4. **Observed context never splits history on its own.** Promotion into identity requires a new mapping and identity-policy schema (§4.2).
5. **Environment and selected resource are explicit.** Environment identifies the shared host; optional resource selection identifies the CPU set, GPU, or partition one result applies to.
6. **Observations are preferred, not required.** Aggregate-only history remains valid and is marked producer-supplied.
7. **Summaries are typed.** Estimates, statistics, uncertainty, intervals, and opaque source bounds remain distinct entries (§5.3).
8. **Canonical units are interoperable.** Use UCUM case-sensitive units when representable, normalize values before storage, and keep the original unit in provenance.
9. **Ingestion is idempotent and auditable.** Producer identity is stable and namespaced; its software version is not part of the idempotency key (§5.4).
10. **Grouping keys are provenance.** The run author defines `run_key`; the executor defines a namespace-qualified `attempt_key`; neither enters identity.
11. **Decision policy is separate.** Direction, thresholds, guard bands, correctness verdicts, and alerts never enter identity or imply a verdict.
12. **The quantity vocabulary is open.** Adding a quantity is configuration, not a schema change; a quantity's meaning and unit are immutable once used (§4.4).

## 4. Minimal schema

### 4.1 Core tables

| Table | One row represents | Key or invariant |
|---|---|---|
| `project` | namespace for project-defined names and policy | unique project key |
| `source` | versioned code or data source, usually a repository | unique `(project_id, canonical_uri)` |
| `workload_variant` | workload plus one resolved parameter assignment | unique `(project_id, name, parameters)` |
| `quantity` | named scalar output with canonical unit (UCUM unit when representable) and descriptive metadata (§4.4) | unique `(project_id, name)`; immutable after use |
| `environment` | host/allocation identity plus descriptive metadata | unique `(identity_schema, fingerprint)` |
| `revision` | source revision plus the optional `native_order` and `native_time` reported with it | unique `(source_id, revision_key)` |
| `series` | derived index: one comparison identity × one estimator under one identity-policy schema | unique `series_fingerprint`; rebuildable |
| `series_point` | one entry of a series: the estimate one result contributes, recording which result and which series | unique `(series_fingerprint, producer, ingest_key)`; rebuildable |
| `benchmark_result` | immutable producer record for one attempt × one quantity | unique `(producer, ingest_key)`; indexed by `reported_coordinates_fingerprint` |

`workload_variant.parameters` is a canonical JSON object holding one parameter assignment. A workload declared with `size=[10, 100, 1000]` yields three variants; a parameter value may itself be an array, such as a matrix shape, and the benchmark definition resolves the distinction before ingestion. A workload may also carry a `dataset` object with name, version, checksum, and generation parameters; it is part of the variant identity, so two runs on different data never share a variant. A baseline-versus-variant study (UC-02) is two variants that differ in a `role` parameter, not a separate field.

`source` and `revision` serve both subject and benchmark code. A revision key has no intrinsic order, and the revision graph is not a core table: history queries take ancestry from the source repository or from an auxiliary revision catalog keyed by `(source_id, revision_key)`. When neither is available, ordering falls back to the `native_order` or `native_time` a producer reported with the revision, as migrated LNT or rustc-perf results do; that yields a linear order but not ancestry, so ancestor-based baselines still need a graph. Without any of these, results stay queryable but revision order is unavailable. Parent hashes are not copied into results.

A `revision` row is keyed by the clean VCS identifier. Whether the measured checkout had uncommitted changes is a fact about the result: `subject_dirty` and `benchmark_dirty` are required tri-state flags, `clean`, `dirty`, or `unknown`, in provenance. A clean and a dirty result at the same commit therefore share a revision row. `unknown` is distinct from `clean` so that a comparator can tell what is known to be clean. The flag, the working-tree id below, and a quality warning exist so that a detector or comparator can filter or annotate dirty results trivially; what it does with them is its own policy. The failure mode to avoid is the one asv has, where uncommitted changes are silently ignored and a result is charted as if it were the commit. Comparators may compare dirty sides within one run, as a contributor does with an uncommitted change against HEAD; such a comparison is *local-only* and never promotes into tracked history (§5.5).

**Working-tree identity.** A result also records `subject_tree` and `benchmark_tree`: the content hash of the checkout that was measured, independent of its commit. For git this is the tree object id of the working tree, the same id a commit made from this checkout on this machine would carry. It is obtained by staging everything into a scratch index that does not yet exist, so the repository's own index is untouched, and writing a tree:

```sh
index=$(mktemp); rm -f "$index"
GIT_INDEX_FILE=$index sh -c 'git add -A && git write-tree'
rm -f "$index"
```

Tracked and untracked files count; gitignored files do not. A clean checkout yields the tree of its HEAD; a dirty one yields a tree no commit has yet. Two results with equal tree ids measured the same code whatever their commit or timestamp, so dirty runs are distinguishable from each other and from HEAD, and when that state is later committed the commit's tree equals the recorded id, so a comparator can attach the earlier results to the real revision.

Two limits follow from how git hashes a tree. Submodules and nested repositories contribute only their HEAD commit id, so their own uncommitted changes are invisible; a pinned component that lives inside the tree needs its own tree id when that matters. And what enters the hash depends on the repository's normalization settings, such as line-ending conversion, file-mode tracking, and clean filters, so ids from different producers are equal for identical code only when those settings agree. The doc does not mandate settings; equality across producers is a property of matching configuration, not of the id. The tree id identifies the code but does not reproduce it; a patch, when kept, is a provenance artifact of kind `patch`. Non-git sources use their native tree hash or a hash of sorted file paths and contents; `unknown` dirty state pairs with an absent tree id.

**Thin local results.** An ad hoc run on a laptop (UC-01, one-off stories) may have no benchmark repository and no project. `project` and `benchmark` are therefore optional, and environment identity may use the `local/v1` schema with only a hostname. Such a result is *thin*: it validates and can be compared within its own run. On ingest the store assigns it the implicit project `local/<hostname>` so that its vocabulary rows exist, and it joins a tracked project's series only after an approved mapping re-projects it with the missing coordinates (§6). When the logic under test lives in the benchmark scripts themselves, as in a Narwhals overhead study, the script repository is the subject: `source` names it, and `benchmark` either names the same source or is omitted.

`benchmark_result` stores coordinates exactly as reported plus their fingerprint, `attempt_key`, the outcome, observed context, observation batch, producer summaries, procedure, quality, and provenance as validated JSON. All of it is immutable after ingest. Promote a JSON structure to a child table only when a concrete query, size, or integrity requirement justifies it. No core tables exist for estimator, unit, procedure, run/attempt, observation, interval, uncertainty component, covariance, revision graph, or aliases; estimator and unit vocabularies are configuration.

`series` and `series_point` are materialized indexes. A series is the ordered list of estimates for one comparison identity and one estimator, for example the minimum wall time of a Parquet read on one runner across three revisions, `[50, 10, 25]`. A series point is one entry of that list, `50`, and records the result it was computed from and the series it belongs to, so either can be reached from the other. The server applies the identity policy to reported coordinates, creates a series per comparison identity and estimator, and a point per eligible result. Rebuilding under one policy schema never deletes indexes built under another. Stable annotations and external references use `series_fingerprint`, not a row ID.

A composite subject keeps the axis explicit and pins every non-primary component:

```json
{
  "name": "arrow-numpy-interop",
  "components": [
    {"role": "primary"},
    {"role": "numpy", "source": "https://github.com/numpy/numpy", "revision": "v2.3.0"}
  ]
}
```

A Narwhals-over-pandas-or-Polars study has the same shape: `narwhals` is the primary component and axis, `pandas` and `polars` are pinned components with their versions, and a study that instead follows pandas releases designates pandas as primary and pins Narwhals, which is a different series.

A result pins the components its workload exercises and no others. A pandas overhead benchmark pins pandas, so a Polars release does not restart its series; the Polars benchmark pins Polars. Every pin is a reported coordinate, so a new release of a pinned component starts a new series under the default policy; a project that wants patch releases to share history maps them to a release line in its identity policy (§4.3) rather than dropping the pin.

### 4.2 Field placement

| Destination | Put here | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Workload-variant parameters** | Resolved controlled workload/input, including dataset identity | size, compression, scenario, role, dataset name/version/checksum |
| **Subject descriptor** | What is under test: components, roles, pinned non-axis revisions, build/configuration | Arrow–NumPy roles, build type, compiler/flags, JIT/AOT mode, backend |
| **Benchmark identity** | Exact code that defined/executed the workload | source URI, revision |
| **Comparison context** | How the subject is exercised and measured; intended settings | protocol version, host runtime such as Python version, warmup/GC/calibration policy, adaptive vs. pedantic timing, timer, CUDA events vs. synchronization, cache-clearing policy |
| **Environment identity** | Host or allocation shared by an attempt | runner, CPU model, available accelerators, memory, cluster shape |
| **Resource selection** | Optional resource one result applies to | CPU/core set, GPU UUID/device index, accelerator partition |
| **Observed context** | Conditions allowed to vary within a series | kernel, glibc, microcode, image digest, load, temperature |
| **Result procedure** | Realized batch-wide acquisition details | repetitions completed, inner iterations selected, warmups performed, round within the run, durations, caches actually cleared |
| **Provenance** | Audit metadata | run/attempt keys, caller labels, dirty flags and working-tree ids, CI link, logs, runner software, references to input or anchor results, patch and dependency manifest artifacts, source payload |

Three rules resolve most cases:

- **Subject versus measurement.** A setting that changes the artifact under test belongs in the subject descriptor; a setting that changes how it is exercised or measured belongs in comparison context. Both are coordinates; the split exists for readability and adapter consistency, and a field goes in exactly one.
- **Intended versus realized.** An adaptive timer's minimum-duration rule is comparison context; the loop count it chose is procedure. A requested cache reset is comparison context; whether it ran is procedure. Per-observation ordinal, group, pair, and inclusion data belongs on structured observations, not in procedure.
- **Identity versus annotation.** A timer, harness, probe, or data-reduction version goes in comparison context if its change must split history, observed context if it should only annotate, and provenance if audit-only. A project that later needs an observed field to match promotes it into reported coordinates through a new mapping version and identity-policy schema; producers do not move fields on their own.

The top-level `source` is the authoritative axis. The subject component with role `primary` may omit its `source`; if present it must match, and a mismatch is an identity violation (§5.4). Non-primary components carry a source URI and pinned revision as fixed coordinates.

**Environment setup is out of scope.** How the subject and its pinned components are obtained, built, and installed, such as a PyPI wheel versus a source build with particular flags or BLAS backend, is the job of the runner or adapter that prepares the environment. A pinned revision identifies code, not the installed artifact, so the runner or adapter records the facts about the environment it knows to matter: in the subject descriptor when they change the artifact under test (install method, build type, compiler flags), in observed context when they should only annotate, and as a dependency manifest artifact in provenance when a full inventory is wanted. This document prescribes none of those facts and does not aim at reproducing an environment; it records enough to tell two environments apart.

A runner-level **probe** maps to a quantity plus the instrumentation used to acquire it: `GPUTimeProbe` might yield `gpu-time` via CUDA events, `OSSMemoryProbe` yield `peak-rss` via a named OS counter. Probe names are not a schema vocabulary. Comparison context and procedure are open objects; Appendix B lists recommended keys so adapters spell the same warmup, calibration, timer, thread, or cache strategy the same way and land in the same series.

The use cases in [`docs/use-cases/`](../use-cases/) and their [template](../use-cases/UC_NN_TEMPLATE.md) reason in four coordinates. They map onto this schema as follows; note that the template's "environment" includes dependency versions, which are pinned subject components here, while `environment` in this document means the host.

| Use-case coordinate | Schema placement |
|---|---|
| Code identity | workload variant and its parameters/dataset; benchmark identity |
| Code version | subject revision, dirty flag, and working-tree id; subject configuration; pinned non-primary components |
| Environment | environment identity; resource selection; observed context for OS, microcode, load |
| Execution context | comparison context; procedure (`round`, `order`); structured observation keys; `run_key` and caller labels |

### 4.3 Fingerprints

The **reported-coordinate fingerprint** preserves the complete tuple before any policy: top-level project/source, the exact `benchmark` identity, and the `coordinates` object of §5.2. It never contains row IDs, an estimator, the axis revision, or attempt/run keys.

```text
reported_coordinates_fingerprint = SHA-256("benchmark-reported-coordinates-v1\0" + JCS(reported_coordinates))
```

A project's **identity policy** projects and normalizes reported coordinates into a comparison-identity object, for example by normalizing equivalent source URIs, mapping exact benchmark revisions to declared versions, or omitting a coordinate it allows to vary. The policy carries an `identity_schema` that changes whenever projection semantics or continuity mappings change; an operational release that yields the same schema does not split history. Continuity mappings, which keep history across a benchmark rename, an added parameter, or a machine upgrade, are applied in this projection step; their shape, authoring, and audit trail are specified in a separate design document.

```text
comparison_fingerprint = SHA-256("benchmark-comparison-v1\0" + identity_schema + "\0" + JCS(comparison_identity))
estimator_fingerprint  = SHA-256("benchmark-estimator-v1\0" + JCS(estimator))
series_fingerprint     = SHA-256("benchmark-series-v6\0" + comparison_fingerprint + "\0" + estimator_fingerprint)
```

`JCS` is RFC 8785 canonical JSON. The server computes all fingerprints; canonical source URIs, number/string normalization, omitted values, estimator method versions, and identity schema definitions are part of the contract.

### 4.4 Quantity vocabulary

Quantities are an **open vocabulary**: wall time is not privileged, and the schema never enumerates what may be measured. CPU, GPU, and wall time; three distinct memory semantics; hardware counters; throughput; energy; binary size; quality scores are all ordinary quantities. Appendix A gives non-normative examples.

A quantity declaration carries:

- **`name`**, stable within the project and immutable once used. Distinct semantics need distinct names: bytes allocated, returned-object size, and peak RSS are three quantities, never one `memory`.
- **`unit`**, the canonical UCUM unit (rule 8). Counts are `1`; rates are unit-per-time such as `By/s`. Synthetic units are named as what they are: a simulator's weighted cycle estimate is `estimated-cycles` in `1`, never seconds.
- **`direction`** *(optional)*: `lower-is-better` or `higher-is-better`. Recorded because producers know it; excluded from identity and verdicts (rule 11).
- **`deterministic`** *(optional)*: repetition under fixed conditions reproduces the value, as with simulated instruction counts or binary size. One observation is then complete evidence, not a weak sample.

Percentiles are estimators, not quantities: tracked p99 latency is quantity `latency` with estimator `p99`, one series per percentile. The same physical quantity may be a measurand in one series and observed context in another; name and unit conventions are shared so a value moves between the two without translation.

### 4.5 Estimators and compound outputs

An estimator declaration has a name, method version, optional parameters that can alter the value such as percentile interpolation, and an input level of `observations` or `estimates`. Project policy lists the estimators it materializes. For every result with sufficient observations, the server writes a derived point per server-computable policy estimator; a result with only producer estimates joins only the series of the estimators it reported. Adding an estimator to policy later creates points for results with observations and never rewrites a stored result.

A **compound estimator** additionally declares semantic input roles and quantities, which enter `estimator_fingerprint`. A separate `provenance.references` list maps roles to stable `(producer, ingest_key)` input references, which do not enter identity. Inputs may be any results in the same `run_key`: siblings of one attempt, as for a CPU/GPU critical-time; or results of different attempts, as for a Narwhals-over-pandas overhead ratio across two role variants or an anchor measurement in a cross-machine study. Explicit references remove ambiguity when a run holds several candidates. Paired observations carry matching group/ordinal or pair keys.

```json
{
  "estimator": {
    "name": "max",
    "method_version": "benchx/max/v1",
    "input_level": "estimates",
    "inputs": [{"role": "cpu", "quantity": "cpu-time"}, {"role": "gpu", "quantity": "gpu-time"}]
  },
  "references": [
    {"role": "cpu", "result": {"producer": "example.org/adapter", "ingest_key": "ci-1234:parquet-read/snappy:cpu-time"}},
    {"role": "gpu", "result": {"producer": "example.org/adapter", "ingest_key": "ci-1234:parquet-read/snappy:gpu-time"}}
  ]
}
```

**How a compound result is created.** A compound is an ordinary result for its own quantity, produced by a short pipeline that runs after its inputs exist and reads only stored, immutable results:

1. **Resolve inputs by role** within one `run_key`, and record each as a `(producer, ingest_key)` reference in `provenance.references`.
2. **Check compatibility.** Inputs must share what the compound's series will claim: subject revision and tree, pinned components, environment, comparison context, and, across attempts, `round`. Attempt integrity (§5.3) guarantees this for same-attempt inputs; the consuming profile (§5.5) does for cross-attempt ones.
3. **Pair observations** by ordinal or pair key. Pairing needs equal counts, which is why the profiles require interleaved rounds and equal repetitions.
4. **Apply the derivation rule per pair**, such as `max` of CPU and GPU time or the ratio of narwhals to native time. The results are the compound's observation batch, kept as structured observations with their ordinals, and the rule is declared next to them in `measurement.derivation` as an estimator at `input_level: observations`.
5. **Apply an ordinary estimator** to that batch, `median` say, as the producer estimate. Policy may materialize other estimators from the same batch later.
6. **Assemble coordinates**: those the inputs share, minus the one they differ in such as `parameters.role`, plus the compound's own quantity. A same-attempt compound keeps the input `attempt_key`; a cross-attempt one gets a new attempt key in the same run.
7. **Ingest** as a normal result. The inputs are untouched.

Because the inputs keep their batches, the pipeline runs identically at measurement time in the runner or later in the comparator, and the compound can be added retroactively across a project's whole history. The comparator has two outputs: a stored compound, ingested under its own producer name, which gets a series with one point per revision and is the form a tracked question such as "does the overhead stay low across commits" needs; or a value inside one comparison document, with no series, which is the form for a one-off question. Same inputs and the same versioned declaration land in the same series whoever computed it; a different rule or estimator parameter is a different series beside the old one, never a rewrite.

A compound over paired inputs must carry the pairwise batch. `input_level: estimates` is permitted only when the inputs have no observations or do not pair, and it yields an estimate without a batch. A statistic that is not a per-pair rule, such as a ratio of two minimums, is not a compound batch at all; it is a comparison-time statistic over the two input series, or a separate estimate-level compound with its own series. `examples/narwhals-overhead-ratio.json` shows the tracked form.

The indexed contract remains scalar: `median([cpu_times, gpu_times])` emits one `cpu-time` and one `gpu-time` result rather than a tuple. Vectors, covariance, and other multidimensional evidence remain artifacts (§7).

## 5. Result contract

### 5.1 Fields and statuses

| Group | Fields |
|---|---|
| **Identity facts** | reported source, `coordinates`, `reported_coordinates_fingerprint`, subject `revision_key`; project and benchmark identity when not thin |
| **Attempt grouping** | `attempt_key` |
| **Outcome** | `status`, optional reason, optional quantitative constraint |
| **Observed context** | optional immutable condition snapshot |
| **Producer evidence** | optional observation batch and immutable typed summaries |
| **Method** | optional realized procedure JSON, including `round` within the run |
| **Provenance** | producer/version, ingest/native/run/batch keys, caller labels, dirty tri-state flags and working-tree ids, references to input or anchor results, mapping version, timestamps, artifacts, payload URI/checksum |
| **Quality** | immutable producer validation, including an observed correctness outcome, and warnings; store-side quarantine/exclusion is separate state |

Derived `series_point` rows live outside the result. Statuses are:

- `success`: a usable observation batch or at least one usable producer estimate;
- `partial`: the same evidence plus a reported partial failure and reason;
- `censored`: only a lower, upper, or interval constraint is known, such as `runtime > 60 s`;
- `error`: no usable estimate or constraint;
- `skipped`: the harness explicitly skipped this known workload variant.

Absence of a row means the variant was not reported. Telling a lost result from one that was never planned requires the run manifest, which belongs to the runner and scheduler design and is out of scope here. Detectors exclude partial, censored, error, skipped, and quarantined results by default; how they treat results not marked `clean` is their policy, informed by the dirty flag and tree id (§4.1).

A thin local message (§4.1) from a contributor's laptop omits `project` and `benchmark`, uses the `local/v1` environment schema, and carries the run-level facts the local profiles need: a `role` parameter, a pinned dependency, `procedure.round`, a caller label, and honest dirty flags. It validates against the same schema and is `schemas/measurement-result/0.1.0/examples/adhoc.json`:

There are no producer summaries: the server, or the local comparator, derives the minimum and median from the observations. Its sibling with `role = baseline` shares the run key and round, and the `variants` profile pairs them. Because the subject tree is dirty, any comparison built on it is local-only (§5.5).

After accepting the Arrow message above, the server may materialize points such as the following. They are not fields on the result:

```json
{
  "series_fingerprint": "cccc...",
  "result": {"producer": "example.org/benchmark-adapter", "ingest_key": "ci-1234:parquet-read/snappy:wall-time"},
  "estimator": {"name": "median", "method_version": "benchx/median/v1", "input_level": "observations"},
  "value": 0.0368,
  "source": "derived"
}
```

### 5.3 Semantics and integrity

**Evidence**

- `summaries` is an extensible producer-evidence list with types `estimate`, `statistic`, `confidence_interval`, `coverage_interval`, `source_bounds`, `standard_uncertainty`, and `expanded_uncertainty`. Each entry records the statistic addressed, source, method, and level or factor when applicable. Values use the quantity's canonical unit unless explicitly dimensionless.
- A producer `estimate` has a finite value, a complete estimator declaration, and `source = producer`; at most one per estimator per result.
- Observations are finite values in the quantity's unit after declared normalization. A numeric array is the common batch; structured observations carry per-observation ordinal, group, pair, inclusion, or exclusion data.
- Observation standard deviation is a precision statistic, not automatically the uncertainty of a mean or median. Unknown bounds stay `source_bounds`; labels such as `stat`, `sys`, `range`, or `error` keep source semantics.
- For a deterministic quantity (§4.4), one observation is complete evidence and must not be treated as an undersampled distribution.
- `success` and `partial` require a non-empty usable batch or at least one finite producer estimate. `censored` requires a constraint with kind (`lower_bound`, `upper_bound`, `interval`), finite bounds, inclusivity, and cause. `error` and `skipped` carry none of these. Iteration and repetition counts are positive, durations non-negative, and interval lower bounds never exceed upper bounds.

**Derived projections**

- A result contributes to a series when it has a producer estimate for that estimator or enough observations for the server to derive one. The value is stored in `series_point`; a producer estimate for the same estimator stays unchanged, and a material discrepancy is recorded as a point warning.
- Producers never send a comparison fingerprint, series identifier, series point, or identity-policy schema. Reported coordinates and producer evidence are immutable; derived indexes change only by adding or rebuilding policy-versioned materializations, and schemas are retained side by side.
- `observed_context` is excluded from reported coordinates and never enters identity; analyses may annotate, filter, or stratify by it.

**Attempts and keys**

- A harness invocation reporting several quantities yields one result per quantity sharing `attempt_key`; corresponding observations share group/ordinal or pair keys.
- **Attempt integrity.** Results sharing an `attempt_key` must agree on project, designated source, subject revision, benchmark revision, dirty flags, working-tree ids, workload variant, subject descriptor, environment identity, and `run_key`. They may differ in quantity, resource selection, and quantity-specific instrumentation. Disagreement with a stored sibling is an *attempt conflict* (§5.4). Resource selection is what lets GPU 0 and GPU 1 results share one host environment.
- Two results are **code-identical** when their `subject_tree` ids match, and likewise for `benchmark_tree`. This is the comparison unit for local work: a dirty checkout against HEAD is two distinct trees, and repeated rounds of the same dirty checkout are one tree. Detection and history still use the revision axis; how a project charts results not marked `clean` is its policy, and the tree id is what lets it annotate them honestly.
- `run_key` comes from the run author, who may also attach `provenance.labels`, a string map such as `{"env": "numpy-2.0"}`, for selecting sides of a comparison. The executor creates a globally namespace-qualified `attempt_key`, such as a URI-like key or UUID, and producers preserve or deterministically map it. Keys and labels never enter identity. Identical retries of `(producer, ingest_key)` return the existing result; different payloads conflict.
- Pairing across attempts, such as interleaved baseline and contender runs (UC-03), is expressed by matching `procedure.round` on the attempts and matching pair keys on structured observations. `round` is assigned by the run author, increases monotonically within a run, and is kept by a retry, which gets a new attempt key but the same round so that pairing survives. It is never placed in comparison context, which would split the series.
- `provenance.started_at` is required on every result. It is the measurement start on the producer's clock and the only fact that orders attempts across runs; ingest time is never used for ordering.
- Ratios, confidence bounds, and faster/slower classifications produced by a comparison are a separate comparison document, not fields of a result; the comparator design specifies it.
- Ground-truth values never leave the runner. What is recorded is what the runner derived from them: an error norm or mismatch count as another quantity under the same attempt, and the observed check as `quality.validation.correctness` (`pass` or `fail`). The verdict that acts on it is decision policy. A full dependency manifest is a provenance artifact; only the components policy treats as identity are pinned in the subject descriptor.
- A result's designated source, workload variant, and quantity belong to one project, and its subject revision refers to its designated source.
- Large observation sets, covariance matrices, profiles, histograms, and similar outputs are external artifacts with media type, URI, and checksum. Migrations retain mapping version and source payload reference.

Physical partitioning and indexes are implementation choices; global idempotency must hold regardless.

### 5.4 Ingest contract

The ingest object (§5.2) is the message; transport is a deployment choice. The litmus test is **file drop**: writing result documents to a directory that is later swept into the store must be a valid delivery path.

- **Acknowledgment means validated and durable.** A positive response promises the result is stored and queryable; the producer may forget it.
- **Entities auto-create; meaning is protected.** First sight of a project, source, workload variant, quantity, or revision creates it, and series and points are materialized without changing the result. A quantity arriving with a different unit is rejected as a unit conflict, enforcing rule 12 at ingest rather than at declaration.
- **No ordering, no deadline.** Results may arrive late, duplicated, or out of order; an offline laptop or weekly batch is valid indefinitely.
- **Batches are transport optimizations.** A multi-result delivery is N independent documents with N outcomes; there is no atomic batch, and `attempt_key` survives any framing.
- **Machine-readable rejection taxonomy.** At minimum *malformed*, *idempotency conflict* (same `(producer, ingest_key)`, different payload), *unit conflict*, *identity violation* (coordinates and revision from different sources, a primary component whose source differs from the top-level source, or a payload carrying a series identifier or fingerprint), *attempt conflict* (§5.3), and *quarantined* (accepted but withheld pending review).

### 5.5 Comparison profiles

Results carry facts; a **profile** is a comparator-time check that a set of results sharing a `run_key` is fit for one kind of comparison. Profiles are not declared by producers and add no schema fields. Each use case in `docs/use-cases/` names one; the comparator validates it before producing a comparison document and refuses to compare otherwise.

| Profile | Varies | Must agree | Invariants checked over the run |
|---|---|---|---|
| `single-run` ([UC-01](../use-cases/UC-01-short-slug.md)) | workload parameters | comparison context | none beyond attempt integrity |
| `variants` ([UC-02](../use-cases/UC-02-variants.md)) | `parameters.role` | subject tree id, subject configuration, environment, comparison context | equal attempt counts per role; `procedure.round` alternates between roles |
| `revisions` ([UC-03](../use-cases/UC_03_compare.md)) | subject tree id | workload variant, subject configuration, environment, comparison context | equal attempt counts per side; `procedure.round` alternates; each side has exactly one tree id and the two differ |
| `environments` ([UC-04](../use-cases/UC-04-cross-env.md)) | one pinned component or subject configuration, named by `labels` | subject revision, workload variant, host environment, comparison context | exactly two label values whose reported coordinates differ; equal attempt counts per label; `procedure.round` alternates |
| `cross-machine` (template example, pending a use case) | environment identity | subject tree id, workload variant, subject configuration | each side references an anchor result from the same run via `provenance.references` |

A comparison in which any side is not `clean` is **local-only**: the comparator produces it, labels it so, and never promotes it into tracked history. This serves a contributor comparing an uncommitted change against HEAD (one-off stories, Arrow local): the two sides are two tree ids, and the tree id is what makes each side internally consistent even though neither may have a commit. The CI path of UC-03 rejects dirty sides by its own policy. Thin results (§4.1) may claim `single-run`, `variants`, and `revisions` within their own run; the other profiles require a full environment identity.

A revision may hold several attempts with identical coordinates, since every attempt is its own point, so viewers and comparators must expect more than one result per coordinates and revision. A comparison document therefore lists the `(producer, ingest_key)` of every result it consumed. That is also what lets a saved baseline be reused by reference instead of re-measured (Arrow local story).

A trend over ad hoc attempts, ordered by run and `round` and then by `started_at`, is likewise built by the comparator under a local policy from the stored facts. The store never materializes such a series: `series` and `series_point` follow the revision axis only, and no timestamp or counter in a result implies code identity.

## 6. Migration contract

Each import records whether observations are structured, flat, or absent; whether several quantities share a native attempt; whether benchmark and subject revisions can be distinguished; whether reported coordinates are complete for the identity policy or *thin*; and whether summaries are typed, source-defined, or absent.

*Thin* means the source lacks coordinates the target policy requires. The importer records the missing attributes in provenance rather than inventing defaults, and thin imports are not matched across sources without an approved mapping. An importer preserves a native attempt identifier when its grouping semantics are known and otherwise generates a distinct attempt key per result.

Importers must be idempotent, retain source payload and mapping version, report identity collisions before writing, preserve failures/skips/limits, reject unit conflicts, and use the same mapping rules as live adapters. They must not parse parameters from names without project rules or copy source-local fingerprints.

### 6.1 Tool mapping summary

| Source | Core mapping | Important caveat |
|---|---|---|
| **ASV** | hardware → environment; OS → observed context; environment/dependencies/build → subject descriptor or comparison context by semantics; benchmark + parameters → workload variant; result → **median estimate**; samples → observations; CI99 → median confidence interval | `null` is failed and `NaN` is skipped. Preserve exact benchmark version as benchmark identity; map its declared semantic version conservatively into comparison context. |
| **Conbench** | native case → workload variant; hardware → environment; source → designated source/revision; context fields split among subject, comparison context, and observed context; data → observations; times → procedure | Derive quantity and estimator; do not copy `history_fingerprint`. Use the source deployment's configured summary policy. |
| **Bencher** | Project/Testbed/Benchmark/Measure → project/environment/workload variant/quantity; Metric → source-defined estimate; Report → provenance | Bounds are adapter-defined. Keep opaque bounds as `source_bounds`; threshold direction is decision policy. |
| **Codespeed** | Project/source/revision → project and designated axis; Executable → subject descriptor; Benchmark → workload variant + quantity; Environment → environment/observed context; Result aggregates → summaries | `Benchmark.data_type` selects mean or median. Snapshot mutable unit definitions. |
| **LNT** | suite → project; Machine fields split among subject, environment, comparison context, and observed context; Test → workload variant; metric → quantity; list/scalar → observations/estimate; Run → provenance | Preserve native order, status/hash, and source metadata. Opaque machine identity is thin. |
| **Nyrkiö** | test path → workload variant; metric name/unit → quantity; value → source-defined estimate; source attributes → revision | Preserve per-metric direction as source decision metadata; conflicts require review. |
| **github-action-benchmark** | suite/project; name → workload variant; tool/unit → quantity; value → source-defined estimate; commit/date → revision/provenance | Interpret `range` by adapter version; otherwise retain it as an opaque summary. History may be truncated. |
| **OpenTelemetry Benchmarks** | scenario ID/workload → workload variant/comparison context; tracked package version → revision; `name`/`unit`/`value` → quantity/estimate; `extra` → environment/observed context/provenance | Its current output is github-action-benchmark's `{name, unit, value, extra}` format. Estimator and direction come from the scenario document; observations and uncertainty are absent. |
| **rustc-perf** | artifact → revision; pstat dimensions → workload variant/comparison context/quantity; collection → run/attempt/observation grouping | Group compatible collection rows into observations. Environment is thin unless collector metadata can be joined. |
| **CodSpeed** | aggregate-only source estimate | No reviewed public export schema supports a migration contract. |

### 6.2 Live harness adapters

- **Google Benchmark:** iteration rows become observations; aggregate rows remain producer summaries; secondary metrics become sibling results sharing `attempt_key`; split mixed context into comparison context, environment, observed context, procedure, and provenance.
- **pytest-benchmark:** round data becomes observations; requested warmup/timing strategy goes in comparison context, realized rounds, iterations, and warmups in procedure.
- **JMH:** preserve fork grouping; map `scoreConfidence` as a 99.9% confidence interval; mode and secondary metrics define quantity/estimator semantics.
- **cargo-criterion:** pair `iteration_count` with `measured_values`; retain typical/mean/median/MAD/slope estimates and bounds.
- **BenchmarkDotNet:** detailed measurements become observations; retain parameters, job, host, statistics, confidence interval, and percentiles with source semantics.

### 6.3 OpenTelemetry interoperability

OpenTelemetry defines no general benchmark-result convention; its benchmark repository reports through github-action-benchmark, and OTLP Metrics is a generic time-series transport. Compatibility is therefore an adapter concern.

For OTLP export, map environment to `Resource`, producer name/version to `Scope`, quantity/unit to a `Metric`, the exported `series_point` estimate to a `Gauge` point, and project/source/workload variant/comparison context/resource selection/revision/estimator to point attributes. Export only usable scalar estimates: OTLP has no lossless representation for observations, source bounds, intervals, errors/skips, or idempotency keys, so the result store remains the system of record. Because OTLP treats attributes as stream identity, do not export observed context as metric attributes when one continuous downstream series is required; put it on a linked log/span instead. When ingesting OpenTelemetry CI/CD metadata, map `vcs.repository.url.full` to source URI, `vcs.ref.head.revision` to revision key, `cicd.pipeline.run.id` to run key, and `cicd.worker.id` to environment identity, preserving the original attributes and schema URL in provenance.

## 7. Scope and simplifications

The following do not justify core tables for current use cases:

- **Measurement procedure, measuring system, and model:** covered by comparison context, observed context, procedure, and provenance.
- **Runs/events:** `run_key` and `attempt_key` group results without a transactional parent.
- **Observation rows, uncertainty budgets, covariance, and multidimensional data:** inline typed JSON for the common case; artifacts for the large or specialist case.
- **Unit and estimator tables:** the quantity stores its unit; policy lists the estimators it projects.
- **Revision graph and alias tables:** source integrations or an optional revision catalog provide topology; audited display mappings provide aliases.

A structure becomes first-class only when it participates in comparison identity, referential integrity, or frequent indexed queries. This keeps the core at nine tables. The store also excludes alert policy, CI orchestration, source-code hashes as workload-variant identity, source-local fingerprints, large blobs, and branch/fork metadata as revision properties.

## Appendix B: Recommended protocol and procedure keys (non-normative)

Comparison context and procedure are open objects (§4.2). These keys are recommended spellings for common acquisition settings so that adapters agree. Intended settings go under `comparison_context.protocol`; realized facts go under `procedure`; settings that change the artifact under test go under `subject.configuration`.

| Key | Placement | Meaning | Example values |
|---|---|---|---|
| `protocol.name`, `protocol.version` | comparison context | Declared measurement protocol identity | `benchmark-time` / `v1` |
| `protocol.timer` | comparison context | Clock or event source for a time quantity | `perf_counter`, `process_time`, `cuda-events`, `cuda-synchronize`, `rdtsc` |
| `protocol.synchronization` | comparison context | Device synchronization before reading a timer | `none`, `stream`, `device` |
| `protocol.warmup` | comparison context | Warmup policy | `{"mode": "none"}`, `{"mode": "repetitions", "n_warmup": 3}`, `{"mode": "time", "seconds": 1}` |
| `protocol.calibration` | comparison context | How inner iterations are chosen; an adaptive target may be a compound of several quantities | `{"mode": "adaptive", "minimum_sample_seconds": 0.01}`, `{"mode": "adaptive", "minimum_sample_seconds": 0.01, "target": "max(cpu-time, gpu-time)"}`, `{"mode": "fixed", "inner_iterations": 100}` |
| `protocol.repetitions` | comparison context | How many observations are requested | `{"mode": "fixed", "n_repeat": 10}`, `{"mode": "adaptive", "max_seconds": 5}` |
| `protocol.filesystem_cache` | comparison context | Requested cache action | `unchanged`, `drop-before-attempt`, `drop-before-repetition` |
| `protocol.gc` | comparison context | Garbage-collector policy during timing | `enabled`, `disabled`, `collect-before-repetition` |
| `protocol.probe` | comparison context | Instrumentation for a non-time quantity | `{"name": "OSSMemoryProbe", "counter": "rss", "sampling_ms": 10}` |
| `protocol.threads` | comparison context | Requested thread caps, as set through environment variables or library calls | `{"OMP_NUM_THREADS": 1, "OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS": 1}` |
| `protocol.affinity` | comparison context | Requested CPU or NUMA pinning | `{"cpus": "0-7", "numa_node": 0}` |
| `configuration.execution_mode` | subject descriptor | JIT versus ahead-of-time execution of the subject | `jit`, `aot` |
| `inner_iterations` | procedure | Inner iterations actually used per observation | `100` |
| `attempted_repetitions`, `completed_repetitions` | procedure | Observations requested and obtained | `5`, `5` |
| `warmups_performed` | procedure | Warmup repetitions actually run | `1` |
| `caches_cleared` | procedure | Caches actually dropped, in order | `["filesystem"]`, `["filesystem", "cuda-jit"]` |
| `order` | procedure | Execution order across variants in the attempt's run | `sequential`, `interleaved`, `randomized` |
| `round` | procedure | Position of this attempt in an interleaved run, monotone per run and kept by a retry; the same round number joins one baseline and one variant attempt | `1`, `2` |
| `duration_seconds` | procedure | Wall time spent on the attempt including warmup | `2.31` |

A `pedantic` harness mode is `calibration.mode: fixed` plus `repetitions.mode: fixed`; an `adaptive` mode is `calibration.mode: adaptive` with the minimum sample duration it enforces. Changing any `protocol` value creates a new series under the default identity policy; changing a `procedure` value never does.
