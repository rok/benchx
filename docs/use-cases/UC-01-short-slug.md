### 1. Summary

A contributor runs a single parametrized benchmark in a fixed environment.
The benchmark parametrization is problem-dependent: when developing an algorithm
which involves linear algebra, they verify scaling of the run time versus matrix size;
when developing an array-agnostic variant of a routine, they compare performance
for varying array providers.


### 2. Motivation

In this use case, there is no comparison across history, build or runtime environments
or machines: the benchmark itself all necessary information via its parametrization.

There can be one or multiple parameters (problem size, execution mode, array provider);
the benchmark may report one or multiple measurements (CPU time, peak memory).


### 3. Actors and trigger

- **Actor:** contributor on a laptop 
- **Trigger:** a manually typed command
- **Frequency:** on demand


### 4. Workflow sketch

Currently, to run a single benchmark in SciPy, one does
(the workflow is similar for other projects which rely on `asv`)

```
$ spin bench -t time_eigvals

```

Here `time_eigvals` resolves to the benchmark function `benchmarks/benchmarks/linalg.py::Bench.time_eigvals`, which is parametrized with three parameters,
`size`, `contiguous` and `module`.
The `spin bench` command runs in an existing environment and may set environment
variables before invoking the benchmarking too that its `bench` command abstracts.

The default view is just display. However, results need saving according to the schema,
for a user might want to add their own view/analysis postprocessing, which is
too problem-specific to specify here.


### 5. Study design

| Coordinate | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Code identity | controlled | |
| Code version | controlled | |
| Environment | controlled | |
| Execution context | controlled | |

Related to the **open question 2**: saving benchmark results may need a knob to control
whether to append or replace existing saved results. This is useful in several contexts:
- add other parameter values without rerunning existing runs;
- roughly assess run-to-run variations.


### 6. Measurements

Not specified, may vary per scenario.


### 7. Comparison semantics

n/a


### 8. Schema implications

- Profile: new
- Fields required beyond the core: derived from the benchmark parametrization;
- New fields not currently in the schema: dynamic, defined by the benchmark itself;
  Each new field is numerical, needs to have a name and a unit;
  If a benchmark is not parametrized, the default field `{name: "result", unit: None)`
  is used. 
- Comparability key: n/a
- Validation invariants: n/a
- Conflicts with existing use cases: n/a


### 9. Storage and lifecycle

- **Volume:** records per invocation
- **Retention:** session-scoped
- **Location:** local working dir
- **Does this data ever need to join against data from another use case?** Potentially,
  multiple runs may need joining (e.g. run one more problem size without re-running
  the previous run). However this is not crucial for this specific use case.


### 10. Degenerate and failure modes

- What happens when a *controlled* coordinate silently isn't constant: Nothing is
  controlled therefore this is not an issue. However, a separate utility to check
  that core values match could be useful.
- What happens with missing or partial data: Nothing drastic, benchmarking runs are
  manually triggered and are ephemeral. 
- What is the worst wrong conclusion someone could draw, and does the schema make it
  harder or easier to draw?


### 11. Non-goals

- build/runtime environment control
- repository state (can be dirty)
- comparisons across commits, environments or machines


### 12. Open questions

1. Where is the information about the benchmarking strategy is stored: e.g. which
measurements to take (CPU time, GPU time, peak memory), how to take measurements
(how to synchronize the device) etc: in the benchmark itself, in a per-session config,
in a per-project config?

2. Support appending results to the local store, e.g. add one more parameter value
without rerunning the already-run benchmarks? For this use case the answer might be
a "no" to avoid coupling between a runner and storage.
